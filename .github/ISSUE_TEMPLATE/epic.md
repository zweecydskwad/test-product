## Epic

### Description
<!-- Brief description of the challenge, pain, opportunity 
(for example, treating people with acute stroke is important which includes timely medication to dissolve the tissue. Stroke is 5th leading cause of death in the US and a leading cause of disability. Getting patients to Neurologists fast and administering tPA can reverse the symptoms.) -->


**For**
<!-- target customers, for example, patients w[ho show systems of stroke, the neurologist and the information technology personnel building the capability -->


**Who**
<!-- statement of the need or opportunity, for example, timely treatment of patients experiencing stroke can save lives and reduce the disabilities that can happen by delaying the treatment -->


**The**
<!-- Describe the solution, for example provide telestroke video conferencing capability to all veterans, provide neurologist access to Image Viewing Solution (IVS) and Patient Viewer, enable telestroke neurologists to remotely access multiple VistA systems nationally using a single set of credentials, and Delivering a fully configured mobile devices to all neurologists and facilities.-->


**That**
<!-- statement of key benefit, that is, compelling, for example, reduces the time to treat stroke patients on-time and avoid the associated consequences and disabilities -->

**Unlike**
<!-- primary alternatives, for example, having to transport the patient to the nearest VA facility through the fastest means -->

**Our Solution**
<!-- does something better – the “why” – for example, providing mobile devices to neurologists helps in starting treatment while the doctor is traveling to see the patient; also the teleconferencing capability is much cheaper than airlifting the patient to the hospital -->


### Success Criteria
<!-- "The key areas where an organization must perform well on a consistent basis to achieve its mission.”	
	Identify the Critical Success Factors (CSF) of the Epic, for example, “Provide Access to Health Care and continue the work on reducing the wait time for our Veterans who need our services.” Note: For this CSF it aligns with a key function for VA which is to Provide Access to Benefits and Services 1.1.1. -->


### In Scope
<!-- Identify the features that are included in the “scope” of the Epic, for example, videoconferencing, telemedicine, mobile device support -->


### Out of Scope
<!-- Items which are not required for the Epic. These keep the team the on track in terms of delivering what is absolutely needed to create value. -->


### Non-functional Requirements/Compliance Sub-Epics
<!-- Include criteria that describe the characteristics of a system, rather than specific actions that system should perform. Requirements are usually in the form of “system shall be [requirement]”. These include usability, reliability, performance, supportability.-->
